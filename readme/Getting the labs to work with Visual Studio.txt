Installation for Visual Studio (I used 2008, on XP):

You need the following:
FreeGLUT: I used "freeglut-MSVC-2.8.0-1.mp.zip"
GLEW: I used "glew-1.9.0-win32.zip".
Visual Studio. I used 2008: "vcsetup.exe". (Online installer, downloads lots of stuff while installing.)


This is what I did:

1. Install Visual Studio with its installer.

2. Put the glew and freeglut libraries (glew.lib, freeglut.lib etc) in C:\Program\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Lib

3. Put the header files (freeglut.h, glew.h, glut.h etc) in C:\Program\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Include\gl.

4. Put the dlls () either in the system or the project folder.

Now you just might have what you need. Try opening "openGL3Example" with Visual Studio and run it.

You will need to add glew #include and glewInit for my lab code for now, but you can model that after the example project.

One more thing: Make sure you have a reasonably modern GPU (NVidia 8000 series or better or corresponding ATI/AMD), and not totally ancient drivers.
